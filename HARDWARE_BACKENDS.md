# Hardware backends

tswap protects its vault with a hardware root of trust. Historically that was always a
pair of YubiKeys; the code is now shaped so TPM (Windows/Linux) and the Apple Secure
Enclave (macOS) can be added as siblings without touching command logic or the on-disk
format of existing vaults.

## The seam

```
TswapCore/Vault/
├── IHardwareKeyService.cs      the seam: recover the vault master key for this machine
├── YubiKeyHardwareService.cs   YubiKey backend (challenge-response + 1-of-2 XOR)
├── IYubiKeyService.cs          low-level ykman driver (YubiKey-specific, unchanged)
└── VaultUnlocker.cs            picks a backend from Config.Backend and delegates
```

`IHardwareKeyService` deliberately abstracts **"recover the key,"** not "run a
challenge-response":

```csharp
public interface IHardwareKeyService
{
    HardwareBackend Backend { get; }                 // which Config.Backend value it handles
    bool IsSimulated { get; }                         // test mode
    byte[] Unlock(Config config, Func<IReadOnlyList<int>, int> chooseSerial);
}
```

This matters because the backends do **not** share a primitive:

| Backend | Recovery primitive | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| YubiKey | HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response, then XOR-reconstruct + PBKDF2 | Two removable tokens, either unlocks |
| TPM 2.0 | seal/unseal a machine-bound key | Windows TBS + CNG Platform Crypto Provider; Linux `tpm2`/tpm2-tss |
| Secure Enclave | ECIES wrap/unwrap against a non-extractable P-256 key | **Cannot** do HMAC or export key bytes; presence/biometric via access control |

A rename of the old `IYubiKeyService` would have kept `Challenge(serial, string)` and
`ListSerials()` — operations the Secure Enclave literally cannot implement. So the low-level
`IYubiKeyService` stays as the YubiKey *driver*, and `IHardwareKeyService` is the new seam
one level up that each backend implements in its own terms.

## Config discriminator

`Config` carries an optional backend tag:

```csharp
HardwareBackend? Backend   // null == YubiKey; omitted from config.json when null
```

- **Backward compatible:** a vault created before this field existed has no `Backend` key,
  loads as `null`, and `VaultUnlocker` treats `null` as YubiKey. Existing `config.json`
  files are byte-for-byte unchanged (the field is `JsonIgnore`d when null).
- **Additive:** each backend adds only the config fields it needs, and only writes them for
  its own vaults. Never repurpose or reorder existing YubiKey fields.

## Starting point: the Secure Enclave stub

`TswapCore/Vault/SecureEnclaveHardwareService.cs` is a ready-to-fill stub implementing
`IHardwareKeyService` (with the intended `Wrap`/`Unwrap` methods and the exact
Security.framework calls in its doc comment). `TswapTests/SecureEnclaveHardwareServiceTests.cs`
holds trait-gated skeleton tests (`Category=SecureEnclave`, run with
`./runtests.sh --secure-enclave` on a Mac). The composition-root wiring is shown as a commented
example in `TswapCli/Program.cs`. Implement on a real Mac, remove the test `Skip`s, then
uncomment the registration.

## Adding a backend

1. **Implement `IHardwareKeyService`** in `TswapCore/Vault/` (e.g. `TpmHardwareService`).
   `Unlock` reads the backend's own fields from `config` and returns the 32-byte master key.
   Ignore `chooseSerial` (single-device backends have no serials).
2. **Add the enum value + JSON name** in `Models.cs` (`HardwareBackend` already has `Tpm`
   and `SecureEnclave` with `"tpm"` / `"secure-enclave"` string mappings).
3. **Add any backend-specific `Config` fields** (additive, optional, `JsonIgnore` when null
   so other backends' configs are unaffected). Add golden-file tests in `ModelsTests`.
4. **Register it** in `TswapCli/Program.cs` at the marked call site:
   ```csharp
   var unlocker = new VaultUnlocker(yubiKeys, overrideKey: testKey,
       additionalBackends: [ new TpmHardwareService(...) ]);
   ```
   Guard by platform (`OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` / `IsLinux()` / `IsMacOS()`) as needed.
5. **Enrollment** (`init` and `create`'s hardware-entropy path) is still YubiKey-specific —
   it calls `ctx.YubiKeys.Challenge`/`SelectSerial` directly. A new backend needs its own
   enrollment flow (likely new `init` branches or `fleet`-style commands); that is separate
   from unlock and is where the on-disk descriptor for the backend gets written.
6. **AOT:** implementations are native P/Invoke (TBS/CNG, tpm2-tss, Security.framework). No
   reflection — keep it P/Invoke + spans and it stays AOT-clean. `dotnet publish -c Release`
   (AOT) is the CI tripwire.

## Redundancy and Phase 6

The YubiKey 1-of-2 XOR redundancy is intrinsic to having **two removable tokens** — it does
not generalize to a TPM or Secure Enclave soldered to one machine. For those, redundancy is
achieved at the fleet level: the Phase 6 "keyring of wrapped keys" gives each machine its own
wrapped slot for a shared vault key.

That is why `IHardwareKeyService` is the same seam Phase 6 builds on. Today `Unlock` returns
the vault **master key** directly (single machine). Under Phase 6 the value a backend recovers
becomes that machine's **key-encryption key (KEK)**, and a keyring layer unwraps the shared
vault key with it — the backend contract is unchanged; only what sits above it grows.

**`MULTI_MACHINE_KEYING.md`** is the settled design for that key model: the keyring of wrapped
shares, why every alternative (escrow / XOR / Shamir / config-share) collapses into it, why the
Secure Enclave forces wrap/unwrap, and the user-set unlock threshold (`k=1` any-device vs. `k≥2`
two-device-required). Read it before implementing TPM/SE enrollment. See also
`REFACTORING_PLAN.md` §Phase 6 for the mergeable on-disk format and threat model.
